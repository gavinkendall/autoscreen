Auto Screen Capture by Gavin Kendall
========================================================================================================================



Codename "Boombayah"
2.3.4.7    SaveScreenshotRefs user setting introduced. Implemented command line options -saveScreenshotRefs=on and -saveScreenshotRefs=off.
2.3.4.6    Fixed Show/Hide Interface bug so you no longer need to select the option twice to show the interface on initial startup. AutoStartFromCommandLine is temporarily disabled when command line options -stop, -exit, -startat, -stopat, or -captureat are provided.
2.3.4.5    "Keep screenshots for X days" trigger is now inactive by default to avoid potential data loss.
2.3.4.4    Fix to Screen Capture method (again).
2.3.4.3    Fix to Screen Capture method.

2.3.4.1    Does not capture image of screen if screen does not exist.
2.3.4.0    Screenshots can be sent to a file server either from the main interface window or with a Trigger. The SMTP and SFTP settings are in their own XML files and can be configured. Help system is available but still early in development.
2.3.3.9    Dashboard introduced so you can have an overview of all screens and regions.
2.3.3.8    Screen now has Source (such as Graphics Card and Operating System), X, Y, Width, and Height. Removed "Resolution Ratio" option for better screen capture performance. Removed internal screen dictionary refresh from Windows because we now use X, Y, Width, and Height either from Graphics Card or from Operating System and these values can now be adjusted. Module tab page layout style changed to be multi-line. Refactored code to reduce usage of static classes and static variables for better memory management. Removed calls to GC Collect. Changed screen capture method. "Region Select / Auto Save" region is no longer created when application initialized. "Region Select / Auto Save" screenshots are now shown in all screenshot tabs.

2.3.3.3    An internal list of image hash values are stored when emailing screenshots so we do not email duplicate images. (November 24, 2020)
2.3.3.2    Can now run an Editor without arguments or without %filepath% tag when using Run Editor trigger action. Includes changes to version collection, change to how Application Focus behaves when application not found (so now adds the application to the process list regardless), and bug fix applied to threads.

2.3.2.6    "Time of Day" Tag is now "Time Range" Tag with Macro 1, Macro 2, Macro 3, and Macro 4 to replace morning, afternoon, evening, and "Evening extends to next morning" fields. Also implemented "Day/Time" Trigger.
2.3.2.5    Macro tag expressions can now parse date time formats such as yyyy-MM-dd and HH-mm-ss-fff (especially useful for the %yesterday% macro tag). (September 1, 2020)

Codename "Dalek"
2.2.5.0    A version that was never released. This was to make startup speed faster but major features implemented for the application (such as Schedules and controlling a running instance of the application from the command line) deserved 2.2.5.0 to become 2.3.0.0! Boombayah!

2.2.1.2    Fixed a bug with saving passphrase and hiding system tray icon during command line execution.
2.2.1.1    You can now add Batch Scripts, PowerShell Scripts, and any type of file for an Editor. Also removed the "Show system tray icon" option.

2.2.0.22   Fixed scheduled start time when running from command line.

2.2.0.15   Strip out backslash if it's in the active window title.
2.2.0.14   Introduced a new tag that gets the title of the active window. Also added a new method method in MacroParser that strips away characters that are invalid in Windows filenames (except for the backslash character since we use that for the directory path).
2.2.0.13   Fixed null reference error when multiple application instances are started.

2.2.0.4    Expanded scope of lock around screenshot list.
2.2.0.3    Active window title is retrieved earlier for less chance in having different titles in different screenshot objects despite being in the same screen capture cycle. Some code cleanup. Documentation being added. Fixed a racing condition issue with KeepScreenshotsForDays and Save in ScreenshotCollection.
2.2.0.2    Application no longer stops current screen capture session if the directory root does not exist or the drive is not ready. This ensures that the current screen capture session will continue even if the drive being referenced is not available for some reason. Useful if you usually save screen images to an external drive but then disconnect from it and want to continue using the laptop's internal drive. Reintroduced the thread for saving screenshots and the lock on xDoc.
2.2.0.1    Fixed bug with empty window title which resulted in image files remaining after cleanup.
2.2.0.0    Support for unlimited number of screens. This was a huge release with the most commits ever in the application's history. (May 24, 2019)

Auto Screen Capture by Gavin Kendall


2.4.1.9    Screenshots count is reset when screenshots limit is reached to avoid falling into an infinite loop. New trigger actions Restart Screen Capture, Delete Screenshots By Cycle Count, and Delete Screenshots From Oldest Capture Cycle. New command "-restart".
2.4.1.8    Delete Screenshots trigger uses ScreenshotsFolder instead of DefaultScreenshotsFolder. Sending a test email from Email Settings logs any exception error and the Send Test Email button is enabled again after an exception has been caught. Email Settings form accepts multiple email addresses in TO, CC, and BCC fields using either ; or , as a separator.
2.4.1.7    Hash included in Screenshot Metadata. Additional debug logging has been included in the screen capture methods.
2.4.1.6    $AppDataLocal$ and $AppDataRoaming$ introduced for autoscreen.conf and autoscreen.conf included as part of installation so that an installation of the application can run under normal user privileges without needing to run autoscreen.exe as Administrator from "C:\Program Files" or "C:\Program Files (x86)" since the data files are being written to the user's local or roaming app data folder (AppData\Local by default).
2.4.1.5    List of screenshots show information based on Filter selection. Filter selection, selected calendar day, and screenshots list index saved.
2.4.1.4    Removed width check on SelectBitmap in FormRegionSelectWithMouse.
2.4.1.3    Small corrections made to Region Select methods after mouse selection has completed. (February 9, 2022)
2.4.1.2    Reverted changes that were implemented in 2.4.1.1 essentially making this version the same as 2.4.1.0
2.4.1.1    !!! DO NOT USE THIS VERSION !!! These were changes to the GetScreenBitmap method which were absolutely terrible and should never have been implemented for dual-screen displays.
2.4.1.0    Attempted fix for Region Select.
2.4.0.9    Various small bug fixes with Region Select to work with systems that prefer GDI screen capture method (2.4.0.1 - 2.4.0.9). Interval section added to Schedule (2.4.0.2). Icon Double Click trigger implemented (2.4.0.5). Screen Capture Status and Screen Capture Status With Label Switcher windows have larger text and Initial Capture is set as default (2.4.0.6). Resolution Ratio implemented for Screen (2.4.0.7). Region Preview fix to work with systems that prefer GDI screen capture method (2.4.0.8). Active Window to work with systems that prefer GDI screen capture method (2.4.0.9).
2.4.0.0
- Interface redesigned to separate the list of screenshots from setup and configuration elements so you can always see what set of screenshots are selected while you're changing things
- Setup module changed to be a multi-tab dialog box with helpful explanations on how to use the various setup options
- Preview button introduced so you can toggle on and off a preview of your displays before you decide to start a screen capture session (since sometimes your display setup can change so this is a quick and easy way to check)
- Command Line button and system tray icon menu option introduced to open a command line terminal at the location where Auto Screen Capture is running
- Password protection for always requiring a passphrase to be entered whenever Auto Screen Capture is showing its interface, a running screen capture session is stopped, or the application is going to exit; no more "locking" and "unlocking" as you will always require to enter the correct passphrase until that passphrase has been cleared
- Screenshots can be encrypted during a screen capture session; such screenshots can only be viewed within Auto Screen Capture and not readable by any other application so if someone grabs a copy of the image file and tries to open it, well ... good luck!
- Encrypt/Decrypt button introduced for individual screenshots to be encrypted and decrypted
- Screens can adapt to changes in display setup so a running screen capture session will continue to take screenshots of whatever displays are currently available (which is especially useful for those times you're taking your laptop away from your desk and want the primary display to continue being captured then later return to your desk and want all of your displays captured again)
- Capture Method option introduced for the Screen form so you can choose between the .NET way of doing a screen capture or the GDI32 way of doing a screen capture depending on what works for you
- Optimize Screen Capture can be enabled or disabled from the Setup form; it is no longer required to change the setting in the application.xml file as this setting is now part of the interface and saved to the user.xml file
- System tray icon is green when a screen capture session is running and not being optimized or blue when being optimized
- New macro tags %x%, %y%, %width%, %height%, and %process% ...
    %x%        The X value of the screen or region
    %y%        The Y value of the screen or region
    %width%    The Width value of the screen or region
    %height%   The Height value of the screen or region
    %process%  The name of the active process
    %label%    The label being applied to the saved screenshot
- "Special Schedule" is now an internal schedule instead of an actual schedule that gets created on startup
- New schedules "Work Schedule - Morning" and "Work Schedule - Afternoon" created on startup just in case people find them useful; they're disabled by default
- Any sub-forms that are currently open when a screen capture session is about to start will now close
- Screen Capture Status With Label Switcher tool introduced so you can keep an eye on when the next set of screenshots are going to be taken, what label will currently be applied to each screenshot, and have the ability to change the label from the tool instead of needing to open the Apply Label menu from the system tray icon. You can also start and stop a screen capture session from the tool
- Encryptor/Decryptor tool introduced to encrypt and decrypt screenshots, files, and text

2.3.7.0    Attempting to fix bug with region select not working on multiple displays. (December 8, 2021)
2.3.6.9    Maybe fixed the bug with region select not working on multiple displays. Maybe. I haven't had multiple displays to test this properly for myself due to working from a laptop since March 2020.
2.3.6.8    Fixed bug with "the handle is invalid" to prevent application from crashing when Windows is locked. The check on the invalid handle was accidentally removed in 2.3.4.1 but has now been restored.

2.3.6.6    Execution level changed from highestAvailable to asInvoker.

2.3.4.6    Fixed Show/Hide Interface bug so you no longer need to select the option twice to show the interface on initial startup. AutoStartFromCommandLine is temporarily disabled when command line options -stop, -exit, -startat, -stopat, or -captureat are provided.
2.3.4.5    "Keep screenshots for X days" trigger is now inactive by default to avoid potential data loss.

2.3.3.8    Screen now has Source (such as Graphics Card and Operating System), X, Y, Width, and Height. Removed "Resolution Ratio" option for better screen capture performance. Removed internal screen dictionary refresh from Windows because we now use X, Y, Width, and Height either from Graphics Card or from Operating System and these values can now be adjusted. Module tab page layout style changed to be multi-line. Refactored code to reduce usage of static classes and static variables for better memory management. Removed calls to GC Collect.

Codename "Dalek"
2.2.5.0    A version that was never released. This was to make startup speed faster but major features implemented for the application (such as Schedules and controlling a running instance of the application from the command line) deserved 2.2.5.0 to become 2.3.0.0! Boombayah!

Documentation being added. Fixed a racing condition issue with KeepScreenshotsForDays and Save in ScreenshotCollection.
2.2.0.2    Application no longer stops current screen capture session if the directory root does not exist or the drive is not ready. This ensures that the current screen capture session will continue even if the drive being referenced is not available for some reason. Useful if you usually save screen images to an external drive but then disconnect from it and want to continue using the laptop's internal drive. Reintroduced the thread for saving screenshots and the lock on xDoc.
2.2.0.1    Fixed bug with empty window title which resulted in image files remaining after cleanup.
2.2.0.0    Support for unlimited number of screens. This was a huge release with the most commits ever in the application's history. (May 24, 2019)

Codename "Clara"

This includes the large user.xml file fix (2.1.7.9), "the handle is invalid" fix when Windows is locked (2.1.8.0), and the removal of the "start when Windows starts" feature (2.1.8.1); because anti-virus software falsely flags the application as a virus if we do that.

This code was originally written by Jakob Farian Krarup as part of his image comparison article:
https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/374386/Simple-image-comparison-in-NET

It has been slightly modified by me to work with Auto Screen Capture's "Optimize Screen Capture" functionality
in that I have simply added an overloaded method named GetPercentageDifference in the ImageTool class which
takes in Images rather than taking in filepaths as Auto Screen Capture requires the difference between bitmaps.

Thank you Jakob!
